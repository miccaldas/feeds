Thank you!</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thanks for the link, it really looks great. And I just realized that it's part of a bigger open-museum site - surely worth a visit :)</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Kinda odd that they don't seem to mention that Lejre is where they believe the Heorot was located - which is the longhouse featured in Beowulf.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">That looks so cozy</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Beautiful, wish there was some science on how good they are as heat insulation and all</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">All the old military institutions needs to be restored and nuke-proofed for the coming campaign. Soon the longboats will set sail again as Russia is distracted in Ukraine.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Not often I see one of the places I spent a lot of time in as a kid (My grandparents lived in Lejre), posted on the internet. Thanks for reminding me of my childhood</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Imagine sitting there during a winter evening around that fire with tenths or a hundred people, drinking ale and honey and just having mad fun.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If would be so fun to larp in there, with bards singing in the night and stuff</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">It looks like one of their boats flipped upside down. The supports are like oars.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">When all you have is a boat, all the problems look boatshaped.</p>, <p class="_29_mu5qI8E1fq6Uq5koje8" id="IdCard--Subscribers--true--t5_2qh4j">Membros</p>, <p class="_29_mu5qI8E1fq6Uq5koje8" id="IdCard--CurrentlyViewing--true--t5_2qh4j">Online</p>])
