('text', [<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">So basically it's dnf, but apt. Cool.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">That was the original idea. I've always liked debian the best, but dnf's output is better, so i modeled this after it.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Nala is a frontend for apt so that we can have prettier output, faster downloads of packages, and a history!</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This update's video is a bit longer than usual but I wanted a large update to show you the power of parallel downloads. Also our improved output and progress bar is beautiful enough you will be glad it's long!</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">You can find the source code, installation instructions and more information here <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://gitlab.com/volian/nala" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://gitlab.com/volian/nala</a></p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is also where we track bugs/feature requests. If you have one please don't hesitate to open an issue.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">v0.3.0 Changelog:</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Replaced aria2 with internal downloader</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Improved the show command's output</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Improved <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">--raw-dpkg</code> by forking normally instead of pty</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Distinguish Remove and Auto-Remove packages</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">add <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">--no-autoremove</code> switch</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">add dpkg progress bar</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">add support for readline environment variable</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Apt no longer redownloads packages with an epoch.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Unrelated FAQ:</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I am using Debian sid</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">My shell is xonsh</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I use KDE with the bismuth tiling script <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://github.com/Bismuth-Forge/bismuth" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://github.com/Bismuth-Forge/bismuth</a></p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Can you put this on pacstall? If not, do you mind if I do?</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Love it!</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thank you!</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Looks very good! Great work</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Any plans to publish it in PyPI ?</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thank you. And I don't, no. It requires python-apt and that's not kept up to date on PyPi. It must be installed with dpkg or Apt.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Definitely gonna try thisâ€¦. Love the output</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Cool but when i try to add it there is no valid public gpg key. Is there a workaround or a special keyserver for this public key?</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Sorry about that, They key was accidentally removed from the webserver. Give it another try with the command from GitLab and it should work now.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is so pretty I want to port it or make something similar for other managers, it's kinda a shame that most of them still look quite bad.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">any way to globally tell it not to autoremove? i don't feel like writing flag every time</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Hmm not at the moment, but I could make a config file for this sort of thing.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Supporting an environment variable might be an easier implementation. Something like <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">NOAUTOREMOVE=False</code>.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Either one will need a new <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">--autoremove</code> switch and/or a specific autoremove subcommand so you can specifically call it later.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In the mean time you can add aliases in your shell where <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">--no-autoremove</code> is specified by default`</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Hi, been using apt for ~ 20 years on sid (siduction). Just installed nala, and I must say, it looks impressive. What I am missing is <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">nala full-upgrade,</code> which is essential for a sid user. Also nice would be <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">nala policy</code>. Besides that, is there plans for integration with bash_completion? Anyway, thanks for nala and keep up the good work!</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Update/upgrade by default is the same as <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">full-upgrade</code>. We have a switch <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">--no-full</code> to change this to a normal upgrade you'd find with apt. We also do have bash completions already.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I too am a sid user. I find myself always using <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">full-upgrade</code> so I made that the default with Nala.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">We do have plans to add more functionality you'd find with apt like <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">policy</code>.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Synaptic is prettier though</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Such a timeless piece of software. It changed almost nothing since i first saw it (3.1 Sarge), and still there's no better GUI for any package manager out there.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Any chance it can offer a mode for machine-readable output? Python's a bummer though.</p>, <p class="_29_mu5qI8E1fq6Uq5koje8" id="IdCard--Subscribers--true--t5_2qh1a">Membros</p>, <p class="_29_mu5qI8E1fq6Uq5koje8" id="IdCard--CurrentlyViewing--true--t5_2qh1a">Online</p>])
