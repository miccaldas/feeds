Audacity the project chose to sell it. It wasnt "hostile"</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">MuseGroup bought it out and they immediately implemented a CLA allowing them to make Audacity proprietary as well as adding telemetry. The software is also an impossible to maintain mess due to vendored dependencies and soft forks of upstream, most of which has been fixed.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Tried the nightly builds but they all 404.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This is a helpful recent summary: <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://librearts.org/2022/01/2021-recap-2022-preview/#audacity-beyond-controversies" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://librearts.org/2022/01/2021-recap-2022-preview/#audacity-beyond-controversies</a></p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Oh, well, but a disappointing one:</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Yet to this day, people keep releasing videos where they claim Audacity is dead, the community forks are the future etc. The reality is that there have been four major forks:</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Tenacity. They <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://twitter.com/TenacityAudio/status/1473342991565836293" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">pretty much gave up publicly</a> citing severe burnout. Additionally, one of the maintainers is attempting to write a whole new DJ application in Rust (until recently, he was one of TOP5 Mixxx contributors), which does not help things along.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Sneedacity. Didn’t do much beyond rebranding, haven’t done anything in the public repository for almost two months.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Audacium. The only fork that produced a release (and only for Windows x64). It is somewhat active.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">AudMonkey. Attempted to create a Qt port, has been <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://github.com/AudMonkey/AudMonkey/commit/e92b0b85986d51e40fcccb41fec61bd261fc52e6" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">inactive</a> for three months now.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In a moment of brutal honesty, the person behind Tenacity’s Twitter account <a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://twitter.com/TenacityAudio/status/1430250854779605002" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">publicly named spite the only (?) motivation source</a> for the fork. I absolutely support the freedom to fork, but I also have zero trust in longevity of this kind of motivation. So I guess my gut feeling wasn’t too far off this time.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Isn't this a dead project? The fork maintainer quit after he claims "4chan" attacked him with a butterfly knife.  I see almost no activity on GitHub.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muse and the Russians win with successful takeover</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The original maintainer resigned within a week, pretty much all work was done with the community after the main maintainer resigned. In the last couple of months development has stalled, though almost everything to get to a release outside of ironing out a couple of bugs is ready.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Hi, (former) Tenacity maintainer here. I won't go into the background for why the fork was done; others comments have already done that.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">One of the maintainers had a bunch of Real Life(TM) stuff come up (this was posted in a private chat so I'm not going to assume permission to share any more details) and after that activity dwindled.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">At the beginning of the fork, I spent over a month overhauling the build system, devendoring dependencies, and setting up CI for Windows, macOS, and Linux builds. That's pretty much in place now. Mostly what remains to be done is merging/cherry picking updates from Audacity.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Personally I'm done with writing C++, at least without getting paid for it. It's a huge relief not having to deal with that mess writing Rust. I'd be happy to hand over Tenacity to someone motivated to keep it going. I have to warn you that the code is shockingly bad.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">After reading what's in the link, now I wish I knew how to code, so I can help tenacity. Those folks are making people sign CLA's to give them free code, so they can close source it and sell it on android and iOS. That's kind of fucked up, if I understood this correctly.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">now I wish I knew how to code, so I can help tenacity.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">In my opinion, learning to code is the quick thing. It's learning the code <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">base</em> well enough to make important contributions that takes forever.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Forgive my ignorance... but EIL5, what happened to Audacity? I know there was a licensing fiasco, but that isn't exactly a "hostile takeover". What happened that I missed?</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"><a class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" href="https://hackaday.com/2021/07/13/muse-group-continues-tone-deaf-handling-of-audacity/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://hackaday.com/2021/07/13/muse-group-continues-tone-deaf-handling-of-audacity/</a></p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Muse Group basically bought Audacity, FOSS software, and implemented heavy telemetry among other things.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Hostile takeover</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">lmao</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Company buys open source software, implements CLA and Telemetry.</p>, <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The Wikipedia "Audacity" article is very misleading and contradictory to what I'm reading here.
