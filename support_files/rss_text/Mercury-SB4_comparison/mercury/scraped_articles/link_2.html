    '</aside> <div class="blog-post"> <div class="block-rich_text"><p><b>This post is about how we can take inspiration from cognitive psychology in order to write better code. It gets a little technical in places (especially in the examples), but should be perfectly understandable by a non-technical reader.</b></p><p>It&apos;s a well-known saying in software engineering that &quot;programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute&quot; (Abelson &amp; Sussman, &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot;, preface to the first edition). But what does this actually mean in practice?</p><p>On the surface, there are simple rules of thumb that all developers learn to follow, such as choosing good variable and function names, formatting code correctly, and writing relevant and non-redudant comments. But the quest for improved readability and maintainability can be interpreted at a deeper level than this, by considering&#xA0;<i>how</i>&#xA0;we process information when we read, and therefore how our minds operate. Conclusions drawn from this way of approaching programming may disagree with some conventional wisdom when it comes to structuring our code.</p><p>I should start by saying that I am not a psychologist, and this is not intended to be an academic article. Think of this argument as a metaphor - a way of looking at things that may be helpful, rather than a rigorous evidence-based exposition of a scientific position.</p><h3>What is cognitive load?</h3><p><i>Cognitive load</i>&#xA0;is a concept from cognitive psychology, originally developed by John Sweller, that is generally discussed in relation to learning. It is a measure of the amount of effort being used in the working memory. Working memory is, loosely speaking, the part of the cognitive system that processes information related to what the individual is currently doing (in contrast to long-term memory, which retains structured knowledge). We know that working memory is quite limited in its capacity (try remembering a phone number after hearing it once) and is vulnerable to overload.</p><p>Programming and related tasks (like tracking down bugs) are very reliant on working memory. As programmers we&apos;re familiar with the feeling of &#x201C;loading a program into your brain&#x201D;, of holding a subset of an algorithm or data model in your mind so you can start to reason about it. This happens whenever we&apos;re asked to look at a new, unfamiliar piece of code (if we&apos;ve just started working at a new company, say). But it also happens with software we&apos;ve been maintaining for years. Any non-trivial software system is so complex that no individual developer can understand or remember how the whole thing works all of the time, so we have to re-familiarise ourselves with the inner workings of a particular part of the codebase before we can start making changes or fixing bugs. Maintaining software is essentially a continual learning process, so the theoretical underpinnings of cognitive load can be applied.</p></div>\n' +

    '<div class="block-rich_text"><p>Cognitive load, according to the psychologists, falls into three types:</p><p><b>Intrinsic cognitive load</b>&#xA0;is the difficultly of learning the task itself. When learning how to make a cake, say, it would be the effort required to weigh and combine all of the ingredients correctly, stir the batter just the right amount, preheat the oven, time the baking correctly and so on.</p><p><b>Germane cognitive load</b>&#xA0;is effort spent formulating new lower-level representations of sub-parts of the task. Part of the recipe might be spent explaining how to make icing in great detail. Over time, however, an experienced baker will learn exactly how to make icing, and so that part of the overall cake-making task will be reduced to simply &quot;make the icing&quot;.</p><p><b>Extrinsic cognitive</b>&#xA0;<b>load</b>&#xA0;is additional effort imposed by the manner in which the learning takes place. In the cake example, imagine if all of the units are given in pounds and ounces but you are accustomed onto to working in grams and kilograms. Extrinsic load would be the time spend converting between imperial and metric at every step of the way.</p><p>Simply speaking, intrinsic and germane load are considered &quot;good&quot; and extrinsic &quot;bad&quot;. Too much germane load makes learning a new task initially harder and slower (while the learner picks up the underlying concepts), but this work is valuable because the next time you come to do the same task, it&apos;ll be easier. Intrinsic load is just the effort required to perform the task - but this should reduce over time as new lower-level knowledge and experience are formed. Extrinsic load is like friction, slowing you down and filling up your working memory with non-essential, wasted effort.</p><p>Hopefully, if you&apos;re a programmer, you&apos;ll already have an intuitive sense that these types of cognitive load have some relevance in your day-to-day tasks. The key argument of this article is that we can (and should) examine programming constructs and abstractions by considering the effects they have on intrinsic, extrinsic or germane cognitive load in future readers of the code.</p><h3>Basic Example</h3><p>Let&apos;s introduce a simple example, while bearing in mind the caveat that simple examples often run the risk of encouraging criticism of the example itself, rather than the underlying point. A &quot;real world&quot; example would require much more space than we have.</p><p>We&apos;re going to look at two different ways of implementing a Django REST framework view (ie the code that handles an HTTP request to a particular URL). The code samples below were taken directly from the Django REST framework documentation. Again, please remember that this is not, by any means, an argument against any particular bits of Django REST framework - it&apos;s just an example!</p><p>Here are the two approaches:</p><p>First, the &quot;long-winded&quot; version.</p></div>\n' +
