  content: '<div id="text-156862747" class="p"> 71-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hall_(programmer)">Jon &quot;maddog&quot; Hall</a> has been involved with Linux from the very beginning, and for Christmas <a href="https://archive.org/details/199405-decusnew-orleans">shared two of the earliest recordings ever made of young Linus Torvalds</a> speaking about Linux &#x2014; recordings long thought to be lost. <p> Hall shares the story at Archive.org. In Februay of 1994 the chair of a user group for the Digital Equipment Computer Users&apos; Society &quot;started sending emails (and copying me for some reason) about wanting to bring this person I had never heard about from <em>Finland</em> (of all places) to talk about a project that did not even run on Ultrix <em>or</em> DEC/OSF1.... After many emails and no luck in raising money for this trip I took mercy...and asked my management to fund the trip. I sat down to use it, and was amazed. It was good. It was very, very good.&quot;</p> <p> 24-year-old Torvalds was giving his first talks ever at a major conference &#x2014; this one attended by 19,000 people &#x2014; and he was nervous. In the end only 40 people showed up for &quot;An Introduction to Linux&quot; and &quot;Implementation Issues in Linux&quot;, but Hall remembers that &quot;there was great applause.&quot; <i>Unfortunately the talks that Linus gave were lost. Until now. As I was cleaning my office I found some audio tapes made of Linus&apos; talk, and which I purchased with my own money. Now, to make your present, I had to buy a good audio tape playback machine and capture the audio in Audacity, then produce a digital copy of those tapes, which are listed here... <p> Here is your Christmas present, from close to three decades ago. Happy Linuxing&quot; to all, no matter what your religion or creed.</p></i></p><br> </div>',
