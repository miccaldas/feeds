  content: '<div><div class="body" id="fhbody-157675183"> <p id="text-157675183" class="p"> An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: <i>Humble, the bundle-centric games retailer that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/12/beyond-radiohead-video-games-one-up-the-pay-what-you-want-model/67921/">launched</a> with expansive Mac and Linux support in 2010, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/01/humble-subscription-service-is-dumping-mac-linux-access-in-18-days/">will soon shift a major component of its business to Windows-only gaming</a>. The retailer&apos;s monthly subscription service, Humble Choice, previously offered a number of price tiers; the more you paid, the more new games you could claim in a given month. Starting February 1, Humble Choice will include less choice, as it will <a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2022/01/11/humble-choice-is-leveling-up/">only offer a single $12/month tier</a>, complete with a few new game giveaways per month and ongoing access to two collections of games: Humble&apos;s existing &quot;<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/trove?cjevent=d73ed97c758411ec80834cc60a1c0e0e&amp;utm_source=cj&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=Skimlinks&amp;utm_content=100017430&amp;utm_term=14555742&amp;cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww">Trove</a>&quot; collection of classic games, and a brand-new &quot;<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/collection?cjevent=deb5aa61758411ec82aad0540a1c0e11&amp;utm_source=cj&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=Skimlinks&amp;utm_content=100017430&amp;utm_term=14555742&amp;cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww">Humble Games Collection</a>&quot; of more modern titles. <p>\n' +
    'But this shift in subscription strategy comes with a new, unfortunate requirement: an entirely new launcher app, which must be used to access and download Humble Trove and Humble Games Collection games going forward. Worse, this app will be Windows-only. Current subscribers have been given an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/s32u5h/humble_trove_retiring_nonwindows_executables/">abrupt countdown warning</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/humble-bundle-retires-all-mac-and-linux-games-from-the-humble-trove-starting-february-1st/">NeoWin</a>). Those subscribers have until January 31 to use the existing website interface to download DRM-free copies of any games&apos; Mac or Linux versions. Starting February 1, subscription-specific downloads will be taken off the site, and Mac and Linux versions in particular will disappear altogether. Interestingly, the current Trove library consists of 79 games, but Humble says that the Trove collection will include &quot;50+ games&quot; starting February 1. This week&apos;s warning to Humble&apos;s Mac and Linux subscribers notes that &quot;many&quot; of the current Trove games will appear on the Humble Launcher, which is likely a nice way of saying that some of the existing games will not -- perhaps around 20 or so, based on the aforementioned numbers. Despite these changes, Trove&apos;s selection of games will remain DRM-free. FAQs about the Humble Launcher suggest that subscribers can download Trove files and continue accessing them in DRM-free fashion, no Humble Launcher or ongoing subscription required. The same promise has not been made for the more modern game collection found in the new Humble Games Collection.</p></i><br> </p> </div><aside class="grid_24 view_mode"> </aside></div>',
