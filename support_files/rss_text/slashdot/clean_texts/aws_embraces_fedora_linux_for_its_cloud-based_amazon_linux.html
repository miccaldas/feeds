Most users, even Microsoft Azure customers, run Linux on the cloud. In the case of market giant Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud provider will let you run <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mp/linux/">many Linux distros</a> or their own homebrew Linux, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/">Amazon Linux</a>. Now, AWS has <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/aws-embraces-fedora-linux-for-its-cloud-based-amazon-linux/">released an early version of its next distro, Amazon Linux 3</a>, which is based on Red Hat&apos;s community Linux, Fedora. <p>\n' +
    'AWS has long tried to <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/how-amazon-web-services-uses-linux-and-open-source/">incorporate Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) compatibility</a> into Amazon Linux, but this latest release takes that to new heights. By using Fedora as its upstream, the new Amazon distro, also called AL2022, is a stable distribution. It&apos;s gone through extensive testing to offer package stability, and it also includes all available security updates....</p></i> <br> TechRadar <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/aws-is-making-a-major-commitment-to-linux">adds some more details</a>:\n' +
    '<i>The distro has had two major releases till now; the first in 2010, and the second in 2017. However, with the third <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/linux/amazon-linux-2022/">AL2022 release</a> the service is committing to a two year release cycle, with each release supported for a period of five years... AWS argues that the two year major release cycle, with updates shipped quarterly via minor releases, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/preview-amazon-linux-2022/">will help keep the software current</a>, while the five year support commitment for each major release will give customers the stability they need to manage long project lifecycles. </i><br> </div> </div> <aside class="grid_24 view_mode"> </aside> </article> </div> </div> </div> </div><aside id="slashboxes" class="rail-right"> </aside></div>',
