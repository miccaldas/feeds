The <em>Windows Central</em> site admits Linux is starting to tempt them. &quot;It made such an imprint on Windows Central that <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tired-windows-its-time-give-linux-try">not all of us even bother much with Windows anymore</a>.&quot; <p> &quot;Heck, Germany (part of it, to be specific) is taking <em>another</em> stab at <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/linux-replaces-windows-one-german-states-bid-software-independence">ditching Windows for Linux</a>...&quot;</p> <p> But what are the odds really that Linux overtakes Windows&apos; market share? &quot;That is the tantalizing question at the kernelled core of the great Linux debate, and it&apos;s the one <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/can-linux-win-desktop-pc">we reached out to analysts to hear their thoughts on</a>....&quot; <i>Every year is a special year for Linux in some way, shape, or form, but in terms of eating Windows&apos; lunch, that&apos;s probably not in the cards for a long time, if ever. Forrester Senior Analyst Andrew Hewitt gave figures to further bolster the argument that Linux is a long ways off from toppling Windows. &quot;Overall, just 1% of employees report usage of Linux on their primary laptop used for work,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s compared to 60% that still use Windows, and small numbers that use Chrome OS and macOS on a global basis. It is very unlikely that Linux will overtake Windows as the main operating system.&quot; <p> With that said, Hewitt did foresee diversification and growth when it came to Linux, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/major-hotel-chain-ditches-windows-chrome-os-after-ransomware-attack">Chrome OS</a>, and macOS, but nothing to a degree that would signal Windows is at risk of losing its dominant market share.</p> <p> &quot;We commonly see Linux used in Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) deployments,&quot; he stated, mentioning that he&apos;d expect growth there since &quot;VDI has grown 2% year over year according to our &apos;State Of VDI, 2021&apos; report.&quot;</p></i> </p> Gartner VP Analyst Steve Kleynhans also tells the site that the biggest challenge to Windows &quot;on anything that looks like a PC is probably Chrome OS... Could Linux continue to grow? Yes. But it&apos;s not likely to grow as a direct competitor replacing Windows.&quot;</div>',
