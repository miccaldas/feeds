From a report:<i> The company&apos;s upcoming Steam Deck handheld runs atop Linux, and its Proton compatibility layer lets it -- and other computers -- play Windows games as well. Now, Valve has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22803980/nvidia-dlss-linux-arrived-proton-game-deathloop-support"> officially added support</a> for Nvidia&apos;s DLSS machine learning temporal upscaling technique to Proton, potentially bringing big FPS boosts and less flicker in games that support the technology. <p> Proton 6.3-8 is the first stable release to include support for DLSS, after the feature previously hit experimental builds in October, though it appears you&apos;ll still need to set PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 and dxgi.nvapiHack = False to turn it on. DLSS won&apos;t come to the AMD-powered Steam Deck, of course, since it requires proprietary Nvidia machine learning silicon, but we recently learned the Steam Deck will support AMD&#xE2;(TM)s arguably much less capable FSR.</p></i><br> </p> </div><aside class="grid_24 view_mode"> </aside></div>',
