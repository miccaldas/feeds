After the launch of the original PinePhone in 2019, the organization is now taking preorders for the PinePhone Pro, a new smartphone it&apos;s calling &quot;the fastest mainline Linux smartphone on the market.&quot; The phone was announced in October, and you can now secure a unit. The MSRP is $599, but it&apos;s up for preorder now at an introductory price of $399. <p>\n' +
    'Since Pine64 wants to make an open source Linux smartphone, its choice of hardware components is limited. Most big chip companies like Qualcomm or Samsung don&apos;t want to share open drivers or schematics, and you saw that with the original PinePhone, which was based on a 40 nm Cortex A53 SoC made by Allwinner. The PinePhone Pro is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/the-pinephone-pro-brings-upgraded-hardware-to-the-linux-phone/">upgrading things with a Rockchip RK3399 SoC</a>. The chip sports two Cortex A72 CPUs and four Cortex A53 CPUs, and Pine64 says it worked with Rockchip to get the chip &quot;binned and voltage locked for optimal performance with sustainable power and thermal limits.&quot; Pine64 doesn&apos;t cite a process node, but <a href="https://en.t-firefly.com/Product/Rk3399/spec.html">other companies</a> list the RK3399 at 28 nm. If that&apos;s true and you&apos;re looking for something roughly comparable in Qualcomm&apos;s lineup, the <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-650-mobile-platform">Snapdragon 618/650</a> (a mid-range chip from 2016) would seem to fit the bill.\n' +
    '</p> <p>\n' +
    'The phone has a 6-inch, 1440x720 LCD, 4GB of RAM, 128GB of eMMC storage, and a 3,000 mAh battery. There&apos;s a USB-C port with 15 W charging, a headphone jack, a 13MP main camera, and an 8MP front camera. The back cover pops off, and inside the phone, you&apos;ll find a removable battery (whoa!), a microSD slot, pogo pins, and a series of privacy DIP switches that let you kill the modem, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, microphone, rear camera, front camera, and headphones. The pogo pins support a variety of attachable backs, which are compatible with both the original PinePhone and the PinePhone Pro. [...] As for the software you&apos;ll be running on this thing, that&apos;s up to you. This is a phone for the Linux enthusiast who is willing to deal with some rough edges. It ships with Manjaro Arm and the Plasma Mobile interface, which Pine64 calls &quot;pre-beta.&quot;</p></i><br> </p> </div><aside class="grid_24 view_mode"> </aside></div>',
