    '<i>This summer saw the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Rust-Independence-Linux-Kernel">earlier patch series</a> posted for review and discussion around introducing Rust programming language support in the Linux kernel to complement its longstanding C focus. In the months since there has been <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Rust-Linux-Kernel-Linaro-2021">more progress on enabling Rust for the Linux kernel</a> development, Linus Torvalds is not opposed to it, and others getting onboard with the effort. Rust for the Linux kernel remains of increasing interest to developers over security concerns with Rust affording more memory safety protections, potentially lowering the barrier to contributing to the kernel, and other related benefits.... Miguel Ojeda sent out the &quot;v2&quot; patches for Rust support in the kernel. With these updated packages, the Rust code is now relying on stable Rust releases rather than the beta compiler state previously, new modularization options added, stricter code enforcements, extra Rust compiler diagnostics enabled, new abstractions for in-kernel use, and other low-level code improvements. <p> Red Hat is also now joining Arm, Google, and Microsoft in voicing their support for Rust code within the Linux kernel.</p></i> </p><br> ZDNet contributing editor Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/rust-takes-a-major-step-forward-as-linuxs-second-official-language/">also expects the first Rust code in Linux&apos;s kernel sometime in 2022</a>: <i>As Ryan Levick, a Microsoft principal cloud developer advocate, explained, &quot;<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming/">Rust is completely memory safe</a>.&quot; Since roughly two-thirds of security issues can be traced back to handling memory badly, this is a major improvement. In addition, &quot;Rust prevents those issues usually without adding any runtime overhead,&quot; Levick said. </i><br> </div>',
