  content: '<div id="text-157724531" class="p"> &quot;Linux fans rejoice!&quot; <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/pinephone-pro-explorer-edition-preorders">writes <em>Hot Hardware</em></a>. &quot; Pine64&apos;s newest smartphone is officially <a href="https://www.pine64.org/2022/01/11/pinephone-pro-explorer-edition-pre-orders-open-january-11/">available for pre-order</a>.&quot; <i>PinePhone Pro Explorer Edition pre-orders opened up Tuesday. Devices that are pre-ordered before January 18th will be shipped from Pine64&apos;s Hong Kong warehouse by January 24th and should arrive by early February.... According to Pine64, the PinePhone Pro Explorer Edition is the &quot;fastest mainline Linux smartphone on the market.&quot; It uses a Rockchip RK3399S SoC that is composed of two ARM A72 cores (1.5GHz) and four A53 efficiency cores (1.5GHz).... <p> Consumers will also likely be pleased with the price of the device. The PinePhone Pro Explorer Edition currently rings in at $399 USD. The production run is purportedly &quot;large&quot; and interested consumers should therefore be able to easily purchase the device at this price.</p></i> <br> Liliputing adds:\n' +
    '<i>While the PinePhone Pro has better hardware than the original PinePhone, Pine64 <a href="https://liliputing.com/2022/01/pinephone-pro-explorer-edition-is-now-available-for-400-linux-smartphones.html">plans to continue selling both phones indefinitely</a>. The first-gen phone will continue to sell for $150 to $200, offering an entry-level option for folks that want to experiment with mobile Linux, while the higher-priced PinePhone Pro should offer a hardware experience closer to what folks would expect from a modern mid-range phone.... <p> In addition to the PinePhone Keyboard, the recently launched PinePhone <a href="https://liliputing.com/2022/01/pinephone-keyboard-now-available-wireless-charging-fingerprint-and-lora-cases-too.html">wireless charging case, fingerprint reader case, and LoRa cases</a> should all work with either phone. </p> <p> But the new phone has a faster processor, more memory and storage, higher-resolution cameras, a higher-speed USB-C port and support for WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 4.1. And those features should make it a <em>little</em> more viable as a replacement for an iPhone or Android device... if you&apos;re comfortable running work-in-progress software.</p></i> <br>\n' +
    'They also add that &quot;Thanks to the recent launch of <a href="https://pine64.com/product/pinephone-pinephone-pro-keyboard-case/">the $50 PinePhone Keyboard</a>, you can also think of the PinePhone Pro as a $400 phone that can be used as a $449 mini-laptop....&quot; <p>\n' +
    'And <a href="https://www.pine64.org/2022/01/15/january-update-more-news/">the Pine64 site&apos;s January update</a> also points out that &quot;Pico 8 Raspberry Pi port works on the PinePhone,&quot; adding &quot;yes, it does run DOOM.&quot;</p><br> </div>',
